# EDA-For-Bike-Stations-In-USA
Explorty Data Analysis Program With Python


The Datasets 
-------------
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:<br>
•	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) <br>
•	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)<br>
•	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)<br>
•	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)<br>
•	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)<br>
•	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)<br>

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:<br>
•	Gender<br>
•	Birth Year<br>

Statistics Computed
-------------------
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)<br>
•	most common month<br>
•	most common day of week<br>
•	most common hour of day<br>

#2 Popular stations and trip<br>
•	most common start station<br>
•	most common end station<br>
•	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)<br>

#3 Trip duration<br>
•	total travel time<br>
•	average travel time<br>

#4 User info<br>
•	counts of each user type<br>
•	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)<br>
•	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)<br>
