Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
•	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
•	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
•	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
•	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
•	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

#3 Trip duration
•	total travel time
•	average travel time

#4 User info
